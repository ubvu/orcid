The orcid-usage-grade and the orcid-potential.\r\n\r\n* [Download and documentation](https://ubvu.github.io/orcid-monitor/)\r\n\r\n## orcid-usage\r\nThis tool checks how active a person has used the elements and connectability of her ORCiD record. (See ```readme.md``` in folder ```orcid-usage``` for usage instructions.)\r\n\r\n* input is a list of ORCiD's we know from researchers using it in PURE, our research information system, and the orcid-potential (see below)\r\n* output is a datafile with additional columns defining the usage grade of the orcid records.\r\n* usage grade is measured by if and how many (sub-)entries an orcid record contains about: affiliation, funding, works, other names, other identifiers, etc.\r\n\r\n## orcid-potential\r\nThis tool checks the pool of researchers in the ORCiD database from a research institution.\r\n\r\n* input is based on a datafile exported from the research information system PURE. \r\n* This datafile contains the DOI's of all the currently active researchers, and the last name.\r\n* The tool matches the last name with the returned orcid records.\r\n",
